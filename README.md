# .github

I used to have over 1,100 repositories in my namespace over at [github.com/eyedeekay](https://github.com/eyedeekay).
This was a maddening, completely untenable situation.
Not only was it a totally irresponsible number of projects to take on, github user experience gets worse as you create more repositories.
Sorting them or archiving them manually was simply not an option.
So I used this tool: https://github.com/eyedeekay/github-archiver to identify repositories with no activity for at least 4 years, and automatically archive them here.

I will direct zero intentional effort to supporting repos in this namespace.
If you want, fork them and start your own thing.
Or don't.
They just can't be my problem anymore.
