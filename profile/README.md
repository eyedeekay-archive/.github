# GitHub Archive Organization

## Background

I previously maintained over 1,100 repositories at [github.com/eyedeekay](https://github.com/eyedeekay), which became unmanageable for several reasons:

- Too many projects to reasonably maintain
- Degraded GitHub user experience due to repository volume
- Impossible to manually sort or archive efficiently

## Solution

To address this situation, I created [github-archiver](https://github.com/eyedeekay/github-archiver) to automatically identify and archive repositories with no activity for 4+ years to this organization.

## Support Policy

Please note:

- I will not provide support for repositories in this archive
- You are welcome to fork any repository if you find it useful
- These archives exist for historical reference only
